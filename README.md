# 6.-SQL

We have such tables in database (MS SQL Server):
STUDENTS (STUDENT_ID, GROUP_ID, FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME)
GROUPS (GROUP_ID,COURSE_ID, NAME)
COURSES (COURSE_ID, NAME, DESCRIPTION)
SQL query should find if any of the groups has less than 10 students.
SQL query should delete all students from group with name "SR-01"
Write SQL query that finds name of course and related students.


you need to create the following script files:

1) sql script to create database and tables

2) sql script to fill tables with test data

3) in separate files all three requests that are required in the task.
